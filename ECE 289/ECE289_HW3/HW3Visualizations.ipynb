Implement a python code using 'community' library to find communities in the Citation network and Collaboration Network (Erdos).

    "### Compared to 'community' library, 'igraph' has more flexibilty to detect communities. igraph allows user to partition the network in the number of communities that user wishes. Obviously this number is bounded. Now, you will use this aspect to divide given network in '5' communities using 'igraph' and observe the results. Also, derive results for optimized modularity condition in igraph. Write a python code to implement above task for citation network & collaboration network (Erdos). Remember that unlike 'community', igraph has multiple approach for community detection. Obvious approach being greedy and it optimizes modularity. Visualize your community detection results in Gephi for both the networks. Label the nodes in the visualization properly. Use largest connected components, if required. Use different colors for nodes in every community. Include image(.jpg, .png) of the visualization here."
